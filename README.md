
Run setPath.m to start RedbKit package (add dependent paths)  

To use the Tensor Toolbox (that can be alternatively downloaded from https://www.tensortoolbox.org/) go in "HOME", "Set Path" and "Add Folder...": "tensor_toolbox-v3.2.1". Open the latter folder at the second level.

go to Thermal_nonlinear folder 

Script assemble_matrices.m  assemble necessary FEM matrices and put data into mesh_data  

Script main_passive.m run the optimization algorithm and save results in folder sim_results 

For the code of the linear thermal cloak paper take a look at: https://github.com/CaliShulz/PDE_ROM_thermal_cloak_PRSA
