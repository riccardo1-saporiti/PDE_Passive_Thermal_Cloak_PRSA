Code is tested on MATLAB R2022a, the Tensor Toolbox used is version 3.2.1.

Run setPath.m to set up the paths involving the RedbKit package (add dependent paths), the Tensor Toolbox (credits to Brett W. Bader, Tamara G. Kolda, can be downloaded also from: https://www.tensortoolbox.org/) 

go to Thermal_nonlinear folder 

Script assemble_matrices.m  assemble necessary FEM matrices and put data into mesh_data  

Script main_passive.m run the optimization algorithm and save results in folder sim_results
